# dotfiles
My configuration files, mostly leaving here for my own use

My home folder is a git repo with `*` in its `.gitignore`.


## Using this repo

Use [this neat method I saw on hacker news](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

Install pathogen and necessary plugins
 - [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)

Install ZSH and [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
